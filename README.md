=============

Import data directly from the internet, via screen-scraping, then generate a quick plot in R.

This simple R script is just a proof-of-concept of how to get web data into R. 

Then a simple plot is generated.

Geological data are fetched from the science-data repository http://pangaea.de, using curl

Then a simple X-Y plot is generated. A screenshot is attached.
