htmltable_2_R
=============

Import data directly from the internet, via screen-scraping, then generate a quick plot in R.

This simple R script is just a proof-of-concept of how to get web data into R. 

Then a simple plot is generated.

Geological data are fetched from the science-data repository http://pangaea.de, using curl

Then a simple X-Y plot is generated. A sample outfile (in JPG Format) is attached.

For other data sets from pangaea, other columns must be plotted. 

At this time, only a single column is plotted.

The sample dataset was chosen because it is from the Berlin/Brandenburg area, 
it is simple+small, it is easy to understand, and has some relevance to my work.
